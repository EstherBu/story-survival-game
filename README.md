__Can you survive this Halloween night?__

In this slasher-style narrative game, your objective is to survive a harrowing night with a serial killer on the loose.
You will encounter text-based segments of the story and must make choices by selecting one of two or three options presented to you.
Each choice will determine the direction of the story, with some decisions potentially resulting in injuries, while others could lead to an abrupt end if the killer catches you.
